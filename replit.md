## Recent Changes

### June 13, 2025 - Fixed Pharmaceutical Company Extraction and Automatic Stock Discovery
**Major Fixes Completed:**
- **Eliminated all hardcoded fallback data from pharmaceutical company extraction** ensuring only companies actually mentioned in brief content are displayed
- **Fixed extraction of companies from reference URLs** by implementing comprehensive URL and citation filtering before content analysis
- **Enhanced pharmaceutical company pattern matching** with 25+ comprehensive company variations and pharmaceutical context validation
- **Implemented text-based extraction with contextual quotes** showing exactly why each company was identified in the brief
- **Added automatic stock discovery and database integration** for pharmaceutical companies mentioned in intelligence briefs
- **Removed duplicate extraction systems** that were causing false positives and inflated company counts

**Technical Implementation:**
- Completely rebuilt pharmaceutical extraction logic to scan actual brief content instead of database cross-referencing
- Added comprehensive URL filtering removing reference sections, citations, and source links before analysis
- Enhanced pattern matching with pharmaceutical and business context validation
- Implemented contextual quote extraction showing the specific sentence mentioning each company
