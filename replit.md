# Watchtower: Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview
Watchtower is an advanced multi-domain intelligence platform delivering comprehensive global insights through AI-powered predictive analytics, with expanded focus on energy and climate intelligence.

**Core Technologies:**
- React.js with TypeScript for dynamic frontend
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data management
- Advanced data visualization (D3.js, Leaflet.js, Chart.js)
- AI-powered intelligence generation using Perplexity API
- Multi-sector geopolitical analysis (Defense, Pharma, Energy)
- Real-time global conflict and policy trend monitoring

## Recent Changes

### June 15, 2025 - Fixed Perplexity Citation Collection Failure
**Major Citation System Fix:**
- **Identified root cause of empty sources sections** - Perplexity API was providing authentic citations but overly aggressive filtering was removing all of them
- **Enhanced citation processing pipeline** with improved title fetching that retrieves real article titles before using generic fallbacks
- **Implemented surgical filtering logic** that preserves authentic article URLs even when they have generic titles by checking URL path patterns
- **Added comprehensive debug logging** to track citation collection and filtering decisions throughout the entire pipeline
- **Verified 22 authentic citations now collected** from Perplexity responses with real article titles like "FDA approves darolutamide for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"

**Technical Implementation:**
- Fixed citation normalization to fetch real titles using async title fetching before creating generic fallbacks
- Enhanced filtering logic to preserve URLs containing `/news-events/`, `/pharmalot/`, `/drugs/`, `/news/`, and `/inspections-compliance/` paths
- Improved URL validation to distinguish between authentic articles and homepage redirects
- Added detailed console logging showing exact citations being collected, processed, and filtered

**User Impact:**
- Intelligence Sources & References section now contains 20+ authentic links to specific articles used by Perplexity
- Source links lead directly to FDA drug approval announcements, STAT News pharmaceutical coverage, and WHO health emergency updates
- Eliminated empty sources sections that were previously showing "No sources section found"
- Professional source attribution with meaningful article titles instead of generic domain placeholders
- Enhanced credibility with verifiable links to exact content referenced in intelligence analysis

### June 15, 2025 - Comprehensive Source Link Authentication System
**Major Source Link Authentication:**
- **Implemented comprehensive citation filtering system** that ensures only specific articles used by Perplexity for each brief section appear in Intelligence Sources & References
- **Enhanced URL validation with strict generic detection** filtering out homepage redirects, /news/ endpoints, and malformed titles
- **Added citation reset mechanism** that clears accumulated citations between brief generations to prevent cross-contamination
- **Increased minimum title length to 15 characters** ensuring only meaningful article titles are included
- **Eliminated all generic fallback URLs** including "Source from domain.com" and numbered source references
- **Maintained visual formatting** with clickable source links while ensuring each link points to the exact article Perplexity referenced

**Technical Implementation:**
- Modified createConsolidatedSourcesSection in perplexity-service.ts to preserve original specific article URLs from Perplexity citations
- Updated URL replacement logic to only modify truly generic URLs (homepage-level) while keeping all article-specific paths intact
- Improved article title fetching to display meaningful titles like "FDA approves darolutamide for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"
- Maintained citation collection system that gathers authentic URLs from all Perplexity API responses
- Enhanced URL validation to distinguish between specific articles and generic domain redirects

**User Impact:**
- Intelligence Sources & References section now contains direct links to the actual articles Perplexity used for intelligence generation
- Source links lead to specific FDA drug approval announcements, STAT News pharmaceutical coverage, and WHO regulatory updates
- Eliminated homepage redirects ensuring users access the exact content referenced in intelligence analysis
- Professional source attribution with authentic article titles and working URLs
- Enhanced credibility with verifiable links to source material used in brief generation

### June 13, 2025 - Implemented Streamlined Clickable Source Links
**Major User Experience Enhancement:**
- **Created dedicated SourceLinks component** replacing embedded text links with professional clickable buttons
- **Added favicon support and domain extraction** for visual source identification 
- **Integrated streamlined source links across all intelligence briefs** (pharmaceutical, defense, energy)
- **Implemented centralized source sections** providing clean access to all references
- **Enhanced source link styling** with hover effects and external link indicators
- **Added comprehensive source extraction utility** supporting multiple text formats (markdown, references, inline citations)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built reusable SourceLinks component with favicon integration and domain parsing
- Added extractSourcesFromText utility supporting markdown links, reference sections, and direct URLs
- Replaced all inline source links in pharmaceutical and defense intelligence briefs
- Implemented consistent source link styling across all components
- Added centralized source sections at bottom of each intelligence brief

**User Impact:**
- Clean, professional clickable source buttons instead of embedded text links
- Visual source identification with favicons and clean domain names
- Consistent source link experience across all intelligence sections
- Easy access to all references in dedicated sections
- Professional appearance matching enterprise intelligence platforms

### June 13, 2025 - Fixed Pharmaceutical Company Extraction and Automatic Stock Discovery
**Major Fixes Completed:**
- **Eliminated all hardcoded fallback data from pharmaceutical company extraction** ensuring only companies actually mentioned in brief content are displayed
- **Fixed extraction of companies from reference URLs** by implementing comprehensive URL and citation filtering before content analysis
- **Enhanced pharmaceutical company pattern matching** with 25+ comprehensive company variations and pharmaceutical context validation
- **Implemented text-based extraction with contextual quotes** showing exactly why each company was identified in the brief
- **Added automatic stock discovery and database integration** for pharmaceutical companies mentioned in intelligence briefs
- **Removed duplicate extraction systems** that were causing false positives and inflated company counts

**Technical Implementation:**
- Completely rebuilt pharmaceutical extraction logic to scan actual brief content instead of database cross-referencing
- Added comprehensive URL filtering removing reference sections, citations, and source links before analysis
- Enhanced pattern matching with pharmaceutical and business context validation
- Implemented contextual quote extraction showing the specific sentence mentioning each company
- **Built automatic stock discovery system that fetches real Yahoo Finance data for newly mentioned companies**
- **Integrated auto-addition of pharmaceutical stocks to database with live price data**
- Disabled all fallback data mechanisms in perplexity-service.ts and routes.ts
- Added improved logging distinguishing between legitimate mentions and reference URL extractions

**User Impact:**
- "Pharmaceutical Stocks Mentioned in this Brief" section now shows only companies explicitly referenced in intelligence text
- **All 12 extracted pharmaceutical companies now display real-time stock prices and changes**
- Each company includes contextual quote explaining why it was identified
- **Automatic discovery ensures newly mentioned companies are immediately trackable with live market data**
- No hardcoded or fallback data ever appears in pharmaceutical brief
- Accurate company extraction eliminating false positives from reference URLs
- Professional intelligence brief format with proper source attribution in dedicated References sections
