GOAL
Produce the intelligence briefs in a **single pass** that is already
fully formatted and free of the recurring problems we have identified.  
No follow-up post-processing should ever be required.

────────────────────────────────────────────
STRUCTURE (unchanged)
1. Executive Summary
2. Key Developments  (4–10 bullets)
3. Geopolitical Analysis
4. Market Impact Analysis
5. References – {{sector}}

────────────────────────────────────────────
BUILT-IN FORMATTING & QUALITY RULES
These rules apply to **every paragraph and bullet in every section**:

• ✂ **Excessive full stops** – Collapse choppy fragments such as  
  “Army. Unveils. Plans to …” into a single, coherent sentence.  
  Keep one period at the end (abbreviations like “U.S.” are fine).

• ❌ **Ellipsis ban** – No sentence may contain “ … ”.  
  If source text is truncated, rewrite it into a complete fact-based statement.

• ⚙ **Bullet hygiene** –  
  – One full stop at the end; no interior URLs or source names.  
  – Maintain original order.

• 🔗 **Reference integrity** –  
  Every URL must load the cited article (not a homepage or 404).  
  List each on its own line, no numbering.

• 📈 **Depth requirements** –  
  – Executive Summary: 150–250 words of cohesive narrative.  
  – Geopolitical & Market sections: 2–4 paragraphs each, ≥3 concrete data points
    (prices, contract values, quotes, dates).  
  Use only full-text sources ≤24 h old (gov’t, multilateral, Tier-1 media, reputable
  industry reports; never video, podcast, or social posts).

HARD CONSTRAINTS
■ Follow the section order above; do not add or remove sections.  
■ No placeholder or speculative text—every claim must trace to a listed URL.  
■ Preserve correct spelling, grammar, spacing, and heading style throughout.  

OUTPUT
Return the fully-formed defense, pharma, and energy brief that already conforms to
**all** rules above—ready for publication with no further cleanup. Make sure this exact process is applied automatically to all briefs in the future and not just a one-time post processing fix.
