You’re at the point where no amount of blind “guessing” in code will work—you *must* grab the exact JSON API calls that Trefis itself is firing in your browser. Here’s exactly what to do next:

---

## 1. Manually Discover the Real Endpoints

1. **Open your browser’s DevTools**

   * Chrome/Edge: F12 or Cmd+Option+I
   * Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Option+I

2. **Load the topic page**

   * For actionable:
     `https://www.trefis.com/data/topic/actionable-analyses`
   * For featured:
     `https://www.trefis.com/data/topic/featured`

3. **Switch to the Network tab and filter for “XHR” or “Fetch”**

   * Clear existing logs, then reload the page.

4. **Locate the JSON request**

   * Look for a request whose response payload is a JSON array of analyses.
   * Copy the full request URL (including path and query-string).
   * Copy any special request headers you see (e.g. `Authorization`, `X-Trefis-Token`, or cookies).

5. **Verify in your console**

   * In DevTools Console, you can try:

     ```js
     fetch('PASTE_THE_FULL_URL_HERE', {
       headers: { /* PASTE_THE_HEADERS_OBJECT */ }
     })
     .then(r=>r.json())
     .then(console.log)
     ```
   * You should see an array of objects like `{ title: "...", url: "...", value: 12.3 }`.

## 2. Share the Discovered Endpoint Details

Post back here with:

* The exact URL(s) you found for both actionable and featured analyses.
* Any non-standard headers required.

Once I have those, I’ll:

1. Remove our discovery stubs and placeholder code.
2. Wire the real URL + headers into `/pages/api/trefis.js`.
3. Ensure the front end lists show the proper titles and open the exact `url` in the popup modal.
4. Verify the best/worst logic using the returned `value` fields.

## 3. After You’ve Gotten the Endpoint…

Reply with something like:

> **Actionable endpoint:**
> `https://www.trefis.com/api/topic/…?sector=health&limit=50`
> **Required headers:**
> `{ "X-Trefis-Token": "abc123", "Cookie": "…" }`
>
> **Featured endpoint:**
> `...`

Then I’ll deliver the exact code diff to hook it up.
