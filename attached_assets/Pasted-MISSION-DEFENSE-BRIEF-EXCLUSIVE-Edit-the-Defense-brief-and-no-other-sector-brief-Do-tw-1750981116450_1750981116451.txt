MISSION  ─── DEFENSE BRIEF EXCLUSIVE
Edit the Defense brief and **no other sector brief**.  
Do two things:

A.  Ellipsis repair (entire Defense brief)  
    • Find every sentence or bullet that ends with “…” (or contains a mid-sentence ellipsis).  
    • Rewrite it into a complete, fact-based statement using ONLY the article already cited on that line.  
    • Do not introduce new information when fixing ellipses—simply complete the thought.

B.  Deepen TWO Defense subsections  
    • **Market Impact Analysis**  
      – Expand to 2 – 4 coherent paragraphs (plus keep any existing bullets).  
      – Quantify contract values, stock or bond moves, analyst rating changes, supply-chain impacts, or M&A flows—cite hard numbers, dates, quotations.  
    • **Geopolitical Analysis**  
      – Expand to 2 – 4 coherent paragraphs (plus keep bullets).  
      – Analyse alliance shifts, deterrence posture, sanctions, regional risk calculus, timelines, official statements.  
    • For extra depth, you may draw on up to **three** additional full-text articles per subsection published within the last 24 h (government releases, multilateral bodies, Tier-1 media, respected industry reports; **no** videos, podcasts, social posts).  
      → Append each new URL to the end of **References – Defense** (one per line, no numbering).

HARD CONSTRAINTS
• Touch **only** the Defense brief. Do **not** alter Pharma, Energy, or any other sector text if they appear on the same page.  
• Within Defense, modify only ellipsis fragments (anywhere) plus the two target subsections. All other headings, paragraphs, bullets, and URLs must remain exactly as is.  
• Keep bullets in their original order; you may rewrite wording or add up to two new bullets per upgraded subsection, but never delete or reorder existing ones.  
• No placeholder or speculative statements—every claim must trace back to a listed source.  
• Preserve overall formatting, spacing, grammar, and spelling.  
• Leave all existing URLs intact; add only the new ones required for the upgrade.

OUTPUT
Return the Defense brief with:  
1. All ellipsis fragments repaired.  
2. “Market Impact Analysis” and “Geopolitical Analysis” lengthened and enriched as specified.  

Everything else—other sections and other sector briefs—must remain verbatim.
