MISSION
1) Verify that TODAY’S {{sector}} brief is genuinely new and data-rich, not yesterday’s text with a changed date.  
2) If stale or incomplete, rebuild the brief using your current methodology with fresh sources from the past 24 h.  
3) Apply all formatting and content fixes (ellipsis, duplicate bullets, inline links) so every sector brief—Defense/Conflicts, Pharma, Energy—is always up-to-date and clean.

STEP-BY-STEP TASKS

STEP 0 CHECK FRESHNESS  
• Compare material in today’s brief to content published in the past 24 h.  
   – If fewer than **5 unique articles dated ≤24 h** are cited **or** more than **20 %** of sentences are identical to yesterday’s version, treat the brief as “stale” and regenerate it from scratch (see STEP 1).  
   – Otherwise keep the existing body and jump to STEP 2 (cleanup).

STEP 1 (ONLY IF BRIEF IS STALE) REBUILD  
• Gather at least **8 reliable full-text sources from the last 24 h** (gov’t releases, multilateral bodies, Tier-1 media, respected industry reports; no videos/podcasts/social posts).  
• Create fresh sections in standard order:  
   1. Executive Summary  
   2. Key Developments (4-10 bullets)  
   3. Geopolitical Analysis (2-4 paragraphs)  
   4. Market Impact Analysis (2-4 paragraphs)  
• Remove inline source names/links from Key Developments bullets.  
• Append every URL to **References – {{sector}}** (one per line, no numbering).

STEP 2 CLEANUP (Always run)  
A Ellipsis Fix – Convert any sentence or bullet containing “…” into a complete, fact-based statement using ONLY its already-cited article.  
B Key Developments Link Removal – Strip domain names, “reports”, URLs from inside bullets (they remain in References).  
C Format Pass – Each bullet on its own line, single full stop at end; preserve heading hierarchy and spacing.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
■ Touch only the current {{sector}} brief; never alter other sector files during this run.  
■ Keep original bullet order; you may rewrite wording or add bullets only when rebuilding in STEP 1.  
■ No placeholder or speculative statements—every claim must trace back to a listed article.  
■ Apart from adding new URLs in STEP 1, leave existing References unchanged.  
■ Preserve overall formatting, grammar, and spelling in sections you keep.

OUTPUT
Return TODAY’S {{sector}} brief with:
• Fresh, 24-hour data (if rebuilt)  
• All ellipses fixed  
• Key Developments bullets cleaned (single bullet symbol, no inline links)  
• “Geopolitical Analysis” and “Market Impact Analysis” comprehensive and current
