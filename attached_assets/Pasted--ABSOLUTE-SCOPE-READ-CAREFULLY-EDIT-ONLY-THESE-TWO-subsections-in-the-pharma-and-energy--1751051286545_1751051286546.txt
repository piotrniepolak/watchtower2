🚨  ABSOLUTE SCOPE — READ CAREFULLY
• EDIT **ONLY** THESE TWO subsections in the pharma and energy briefs:
    ① Market Impact Analysis
    ② Geopolitical Analysis
• DO NOT change anything else—no headings, no bullets outside these subsections, no other sections, no Defense brief.

TASKS (apply solely inside the two target subsections in the two target sectors)

STEP 1 — CHECK DEPTH
If a subsection is <175 words OR mentions <3 concrete data points (prices, contract values, official quotes, dates), mark it “thin” and proceed to Step 2.  
If it already meets both thresholds, leave its content intact except for minor grammar fixes in that subsection.

STEP 2 — UPGRADE (“thin” subsections only)
a. Expand to **2–4 coherent paragraphs** (keep any existing bullets in their original order).  
   – *Market Impact:* include pricing moves, supply-chain effects, regulatory filings, equity/credit reactions, deal flow, commodities/FX—quote hard numbers & dates.  
   – *Geopolitical:* cover policy shifts, trade/IP disputes, alliances (e.g., OPEC+), sanctions, regional risk calculus—cite timelines & official statements.  
b. Draw on up to **3** new full-text sources from the last 24 h (regulators, multilateral bodies, Tier-1 media, respected industry reports; NO videos/podcasts/social).  
c. Append each new URL to **References – {{sector}}** (one per line, no numbering).

STEP 3 — ELLIPSIS FIX (inside these subsections only)
Replace every sentence or bullet containing “…” with a complete, fact-based statement using **only** its already-cited article.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
■ Touch NOTHING outside Market Impact Analysis and Geopolitical Analysis for energy and pharma sectors.  
■ Keep bullet order; may rewrite wording or add max **2** new bullets per upgraded subsection—never delete or reorder existing ones.  
■ No placeholder or speculative text—every claim must be traceable to a listed URL.  
■ Leave all other sections, headings, and existing URLs exactly as they are (except for the new references you add).  
■ Maintain pristine formatting, spacing, grammar, and spelling.

OUTPUT
Return the energy and pharma briefs with ONLY its Market Impact Analysis and Geopolitical Analysis subsections strengthened per above.  
Everything else remains verbatim.
