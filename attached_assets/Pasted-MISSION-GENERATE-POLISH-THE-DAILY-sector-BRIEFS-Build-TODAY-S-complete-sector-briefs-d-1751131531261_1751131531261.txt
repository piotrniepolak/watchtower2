MISSION ─ GENERATE & POLISH THE DAILY {{sector}} BRIEFS
Build TODAY’S complete {{sector}} briefs (defense, pharma, energy) **from scratch** and deliver it already polished—no separate
post-processing required.  Three tasks must be fulfilled automatically during generation:

────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 1 — WRITE ROBUST ANALYTICS
Create the four standard sections in this order:

  1. Executive Summary
  2. Key Developments  (4-10 bullets)
  3. Geopolitical Analysis
  4. Market Impact Analysis

Requirements for §§ 3-4 (Geopolitical, Market):
• 2–4 cohesive paragraphs each (plus keep bullets if you add them).  
• Minimum ~200 words per subsection.  
• Embed at least three concrete data points (prices, contract values, official
  quotes, dates) per subsection.  
• Use only full-text sources published in the past 24 h
  (gov’t releases, multilateral bodies, Tier-1 media, credible industry reports;
  **no** videos/podcasts/social posts).

────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 2 — FORMAT KEY DEVELOPMENTS CORRECTLY
While writing the Key Developments list:
• Begin each item with ONE bullet or dash, then a space.  
• Do NOT sprinkle extra full stops—place **exactly one full stop at the end** of each
  bullet and nowhere else (unless the headline itself contains a period).  
• Exclude inline source names/links; citations live only in the References block.  
• Preserve logical order of importance;  do not insert trailing ellipses.

────────────────────────────────────────────
TASK 3 — BUILD A CLEAN REFERENCES BLOCK
After drafting the four sections, add **References – {{sector}}**:  
• List every source URL used, one per line, no numbering.  
• Verify each link loads the full article (not a homepage or 404).  
• Omit any link that cannot be validated after a good-faith search.

────────────────────────────────────────────
HARD CONSTRAINTS
■ Use only information traceable to the listed URLs—no placeholders, speculation, or
  AI-hallucinated facts.  
■ Do not reorder the four main sections.  
■ No paywalled or inaccessible links.  
■ Maintain consistent heading style and clean spacing throughout the brief.

OUTPUT
Return TODAY’S {{sector}} briefs—complete, well-formatted, with deep Geopolitical and
Market analyses, a spotless Key Developments list, and a verified References block.
