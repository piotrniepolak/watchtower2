You are updating the `<WorldHealthMap>` component in our PharmaWatch dashboard to compute its healthiness score from **all** the columns in the WHO Statistical Annex dataset—except for the explicitly non‐health metrics like road traffic mortality and suicide mortality. The CSV at https://www.who.int/data/gho/whs-annex/ contains 38 columns; your task is to:

1. **Fetch & parse the CSV**  
   - Download the full WHO WHS Annex CSV.  
   - Parse the header row to discover all 38 column names.

2. **Filter out unrelated columns**  
   - Exclude only these non-health indicators:  
     - **Road traffic mortality rate**  
     - **Suicide mortality rate**  
   - Keep every other column (≈36 remaining) as part of your scoring.

3. **Normalize each indicator**  
   - For positive‐direction metrics (higher = better), normalize via  
     \[
       N = \frac{X - \min}{\max - \min}
     \]  
   - For negative‐direction metrics (lower = better), normalize via  
     \[
       N = \frac{\max - X}{\max - \min}
     \]

4. **Apply equal weights**  
   - Assign each of the remaining indicators equal weight \(w = 1 / 36\).  
   - Compute each country’s composite health score:  
     ```js
     const score = 100 * indicators.reduce(
       (sum, key) => sum + w * normalize(key, valueByCountry[key]),
       0
     );
     ```

5. **Integrate with the map**  
   - Build `healthScoresByIso = { USA: 82.3, FRA: 78.5, … }`.  
   - In your `<Geography>` mapping, set  
     ```jsx
     fill={getCountryColor(healthScoresByIso[geo.properties.ISO_A3])}
     ```  
   - Maintain the green→yellow→red scale and hover‐lift/click‐to‐modal behavior.

6. **Performance & caching**  
   - Cache the parsed CSV & normalized scores locally so you don’t re‐download on every render.  

Deliver a code diff or updated component that:  
- Dynamically reads all columns of the WHO annex CSV  
- Excludes only “Road traffic mortality rate” and “Suicide mortality rate”  
- Normalizes & equally weights the remaining ≈36 health indicators  
- Computes a 0–100 composite score per country  
- Color‐codes each country on the map accordingly, preserving existing interactivity.
